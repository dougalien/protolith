"""Gibbs energy minimization for the Holland & Powell engine.

The stable assemblage at fixed T, P and bulk composition is found by linear programming with column
generation, the "levelling" idea behind Perple_X and MAGEMin, in our own form:

1. Each solution phase is represented by a few trial compositions ("columns"), each pure phase by one.
   A linear programme picks the amounts that minimize G with mass balance exact; its dual values are
   the chemical potentials gamma of the oxide components.
2. For every solution phase, the composition p that minimizes the driving force
   f(p) = G(p) - c(p) . gamma (per formula unit) is found with the site fractions kept >= 0.  Any
   column with f < 0 lowers G and is added.
3. Steps 1-2 repeat until no phase has a negative driving force.  The columns in use are then the
   stable phases; a phase may appear twice across a solvus (two feldspars, two amphiboles).

Units: kJ, K, kbar, moles of oxides.
